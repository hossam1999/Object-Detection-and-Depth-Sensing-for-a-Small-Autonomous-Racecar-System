# Overview
This project focuses on building the perception stage of a small autonomous racecar system running on `ZED Stereo Camera` is used for visual input. The algorithm is developed in `Python 3` using `Robot Operating System (ROS)`. It uses `YOLO v4_tiny` to extract the detected objects in the racecar's environment and their estimated distances are obtained from the stereo camera parameters. This information is then fed to the master controller of the ROS node, which can then be used to plan and control the autonomous racecar. This algorithm can run in real time with GPU.
